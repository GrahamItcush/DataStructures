# A collection of data structure assignments

This repository contains some work from my Data Structures course that I am proud of.

The graphs assignment consisted of building a graph from a randomly generated matrix, then creating an adjacency matrix and listing the adjacency list at each level.

The hash table assignment consisted of building on a previous lab by implementing collision handling to the has tables. This required an implementaion of linear,
quadratic, and double hashing to be made. Once these were implemented the numbers could be added and collisions handled.
